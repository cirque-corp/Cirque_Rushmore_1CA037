This directory contains a sample program that demonstrates the usage of Cirque's Gen4 touchpad solutions with a Teensy 3.2 development board acting as the host.

This project is intended to run on the Cirque 02-000658-00 PCB, with a Teensy 3.2 on-board.

This project presents how to read and interpret data from the Gen4 touchpads. This is presented via Serial Port. 
You can also change various configuration and print settings by sending commands via Serial Port. Send 'h' for a full list of commands. 

NOTE: The Arduino IDE requires projects to be located in a folder with a name that matches that of the .ino file (in this case, Gen4DevKit).
