This directory contains a sample program that demonstrates the usage of Cirque's Gen4 touchpad solutions with a Teensy 3.2 development board acting as the host.

This project is intended to run on the Cirque 02-000658-00 PCB, with a Teensy 3.2 on-board.

NOTE: The Arduino IDE requires projects to be located in a folder with a name that matches that of the .ino file (in this case, Gen4DevKit).
